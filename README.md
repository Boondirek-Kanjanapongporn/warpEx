# warpEx

Language: C++, C

Framework/Modules: OpenCV, Tesseract, Leptonica, Raylib

warpEx is my 1st year Final Project for C++ class. warpEx is an object-detecter, image-scanner, and a text extractor application. It can be used to extract 5 languages (Thai, English, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese) using Tesseract API by Google. Furthermore, warpEx can do image scanning from the user's gallery and the camera. With its capability of ojection detection, the user can take picture of the paper at any angle. With OpenCV, warpEx can detect the paper and use Warp algorithms to warp the paper image into straight. After warping, the application will change the picture to look like a scanned image out of the prtiner with sharp percision. Furthermore, warpEx uses Leptonica for text-detector and can extract up to 5 languages out of the image. It can detect and extract Thai, English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese using Tesseract API created by Google. For friendly interface, warpEx uses Raylib for creating its User-Interface (UI).
